The front end of a "Paradise Nursery" shopping application. The application interface will allow you to browse a variety of houseplants and add them to a shopping cart. The shopping cart feature lets you see all your items and their total cost. Your shopping cart should also allow you to adjust the number of items in the cart before checkout.
The application has three pages: a landing page, a product listing page, and a shopping cart page.
